# `033` isPersonOldEnoughToDrinkAndDrive

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `isPersonOldEnoughToDrinkAndDrive`.
Given a `person` object, that contains an `age` property, `isPersonOldEnoughToDrinkAndDrive` returns whether the given person is old enough to legally drink and drive in the United States.

## Example:

```Javascript
var person = {
  age: 45
};
var output = isPersonOldEnoughToDrinkAndDrive(obj);
console.log(output); // --> false
```
## 💡 Hint:

+ The legal drinking age in the United States is `21`.

+ The legal driving age in the United States is `16`.

+ It is always illegal to drink and drive in the United States 😆.
