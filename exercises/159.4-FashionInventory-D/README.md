# `159-4` FashionInventory-D

## üìù Instructions:

You have a fashion catalog, an inventory of items from various high-fashion designers.

Each designer has a lineup of shoes. Each shoe has a name and a price.

It looks like this:

```Js
var inventory = [
  {
    name: 'Brunello Cucinelli',
    shoes: [
      {name: 'tasselled black low-top lace-up', price: 1000},
      {name: 'tasselled green low-top lace-up', price: 1100},
      {name: 'plain beige suede moccasin', price: 950},
      {name: 'plain olive suede moccasin', price: 1050}
    ]
  },
  {
    name: 'Gucci',
    shoes: [
      {name: 'red leather laced sneakers', price: 800},
      {name: 'black leather laced sneakers', price: 900}
    ]
  }
];
```

The task now is to find the laced shoes but we are going to render them in a somewhat complex format. 

Your function should return shoe names containing 'lace' in them, and indicate which word contains 'lace'.

The return value's format should be structured like this:

```Js
[
  {
    "nameWords": [
      "tasselled",
      "black",
      "low-top",
      "lace-up"
    ],
    "targetWordIndex": 3
  },
  {
    "nameWords": [
      "tasselled",
      "green",
      "low-top",
      "lace-up"
    ],
    "targetWordIndex": 3
  },
  {
    "nameWords": [
      "red",
      "leather",
      "laced",
      "sneakers"
    ],
    "targetWordIndex": 2
  },
  {
    "nameWords": [
      "black",
      "leather",
      "laced",
      "sneakers"
    ],
    "targetWordIndex": 2
  }
]
```
